# My fizz_buzz assignement at CraftsAcademy prep course

## Assignement
Our assignement was to write a program, Fizz_Buzz, that takes a number or an array of numbers and returns 'fizz', 'buzz' or 'fizz buzz' or the number greater than zero. We had to do several tests of the program and get intentional 'error messages' to figure out how to move forward. As an extra credit we could add code that comply with 'irregular' user behavior such as a negative number or a string.

## Install
I added `rspec` to Gemfile and ran `$ bundle install`

## How to use application
Put
    `fizz_buzz("any number divisible by 3")` returns 'fizz'

    `fizz_buzz("any number divisible by 5")` returns 'buzz'

    `fizz_buzz("any number divisible by 15")` returns 'fizz buzz'

    `fizz_buzz("a number NOT divisible by 3, 5, 15")` returns number

    `fizz_buzz("a negative number")` returns 'Do not give me any negative numbers. Thanks'.
