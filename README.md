# My fizz_buzz assignement at CraftsAcademy prep course week 3

1. Our assignement was to write a program, Fizz_Buzz, that takes a number or an array of numbers and returns 'fizz', 'buzz' or 'fizz buzz' or the number greater than zero. We had to do several tests of the program and get intentional 'error messages' to figure out how to move forward. As an extra credit we could add code that comply with 'irregular' user behavior such as a negative number or a string.

2. Gems used: (1) Rspec

3. Put in a number, any number and see what happens. If the number is divisible by 3 it will return 'fizz', if it is divisible by 5 it will return 'buzz', if it is divisible by 15 it will return 'fizz buzz.' If you put in a positive number not divisible by 3, 5 or 15 it will return that number.
If you put in an irregular number such as - 7 it will return 'Do not give me any negative numbers. Thanks'.
